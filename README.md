# **AutoLink**

### *Connecting car parts, builds, and ideas*

**AutoLink** is an application designed to help car enthusiasts plan and organize car modifications. The user can build by adding parts such as wheels, tires, suspension, and exhaust systems, and then run a fitment check to see if the components are compatible with each other. The checker will verify wheel and tire size, warn of rolling diameter differences, and flag up potential clearance issues. The app will also provide a build summary, parts list, and total build costs from the user’s inputs. This software is intended for hobbyists, students, and auto enthusiasts who want to try out auto modifications offline and in a risk-free environment. It will be useful to those who want to find out how their chosen components interact with each other and function separately before really modifying their vehicles in real life, which can save them time and money. Another use of this app is to just use it as a summary list alongside your journey of modifying a car. It can be a place where you can input all the work you have done in an organized and easy to follow format. It can be used by users to refine their skills and to test out new ways to modify their cars that they might have otherwise missed. 

Why have I chosen to do this specific project? I have always been a car enthusiast. From watching F&F movies when I was younger to now being in a community of like-minded people, this interest of mine came to mind when thinking of project Ideas. I always wanted to integrate my two passions (software development and cars) in a way where I could demonstrate my knowledge and experience. This project is manageable and innovative as it allows me to take two things that I enjoy and put them together into a worthwhile experience. Through **AutoLink** I will be able to apply and implement fundamental software design principles like problem-solving, usability, and modularity, while at the same time doing something that I have an interest in on a personal level.
